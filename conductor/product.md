# Initial Concept
Briefly AI is a YouTube Video Summarizer Agent.

# Product Guide

## Target Users
- Students and researchers needing efficient summaries of educational material.
- Professionals staying updated on industry trends.
- General YouTube Users: Anyone who wants to save time and extract key information from videos without watching them in full.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Insight Extraction:** Automatically extracts key insights and actionable items from video content.
- **Spoiler Management:** Intelligently determines when to withhold critical plot points or endings to preserve the viewing experience if the video is deemed "worth watching."
- **Efficiency:** Drastically reduces the time required to consume video content by highlighting only what matters.

## Key Features
- **Smart Input:** Unified input field for processing YouTube videos or discovering channels.
- **Spoiler-Free Mode:** A toggleable mode that hides spoilers.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Analyzes content quality and relevance to assign a "Recommendation Score," advising users if the full video is worth their time.
- **Structured Summaries:** Delivers clear, structured summaries directly in the dashboard.
- **Customizable Prompts & Personas:** Allows users to define custom instructions or "personas" for summarization. Users can specify what details to focus on (e.g., gambling hands, catchphrases, funny moments) and set strict spoiler constraints (e.g., "don't reveal the final win/loss amount").

## Future Vision
- **Multi-Channel Delivery:** Expansion to email, SMS, and WhatsApp for delivering summaries.
- **Subscription Automation:** Users can subscribe to specific YouTube channels to receive automatic summaries of new uploads.
