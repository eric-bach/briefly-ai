# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Casual and Witty:** The voice of Briefly AI should be conversational and engaging, using humor where appropriate to make the experience feel less like a tool and more like a companion.
- **Clarity and Wit:** Summaries should be concise but delivered with a sharp, intelligent edge.

## Brand Messaging
- **Primary: Smart Summarization:** Highlight the AI's ability to dig deep and find the most important parts of a video.
- **Secondary: Time Efficiency:** Emphasize how much time users save while still getting the best "meat" from their favorite content.

## Visual Identity
- **Clean and Modern Aesthetic:** Prioritize a bright, high-contrast UI with plenty of white space and crisp typography.
- **Minimalist Functionality:** Ensure the layout is dense with information but easy to navigate, avoiding unnecessary clutter.
- **No Dark Mode:** The default and primary experience is a "light" theme.

## Content Delivery
- **Visual Callouts:** Use bold headers, bulleted lists, and meaningful emoji (e.g., 💡, ✅, ⚠️) to categorize and highlight key insights and action items.
- **Spoiler Management:** When spoiler-free mode is *not* enabled, provide the full summary but precede it with a prominent "Spoiler Warning" if the video contains significant plot points or revelations.

## User Interaction
- **Recommendation First:** Always lead with the "Recommendation Score" to help the user decide immediately if they should watch or just read.
